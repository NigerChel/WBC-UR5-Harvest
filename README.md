# WBC-UR5-Harvest

Whole-Body Control (WBC) system for a UR5e robotic arm applied to fruit harvesting.

This repository contains ROS Melodic packages implementing a whole-body control algorithm for a 6-DoF UR5e manipulator, based on the approach of Twan Koolen. The system has been tested both in simulation (Gazebo) and on a real robot.

## 🛠 System Overview
- **Robot platform**: UR5e
- **ROS version**: Melodic
- **OS**: Ubuntu 18.04
- **Simulation**: Gazebo
- **Real-world deployment**: Fully compatible
- **Main package**: `wbc_ur5`

## 📦 Main Features
- Whole-body control for manipulation under task-space constraints
- Gravity compensation and Cartesian task tracking
- Integrated with real-time fruit harvesting application
- Modular architecture based on ROS nodes and services
